**Description**  
Robots of the future will need to operate autonomously in unstructured and unseen environments. It is imperative that these systems are built on intelligent and adaptive algorithms. Learning by interaction through reinforcement offers a natural mechanism to postulate these problems.  

This graduate-level seminar course will cover topics and new research frontiers in reinforcement learning (RL). Planned topics include: Model-Based and Model-Free RL, Policy Search, Monte Carlo Tree Search, off-policy evaluation, temporal abstraction/hierarchical approaches, inverse reinforcement learning and imitation learning.

**Learning objectives**  

At the end of this course, you will:  
1. Acquire familiarity with state of the art in RL
2. Articulate limitations of current work, identify open frontiers, and scope research projects.
3. Constructively critique research papers, and deliver a tutorial style presentation.
4. Work on a research based project, implement & evaluate experimental results, and discuss future work in a project paper.

**Prerequisites**

You need to be comfortable with:
- introductory machine learning concepts (such as from CSC411/ECE521 or equivalent),
- linear algebra,
- basic multivariable calculus,
- intro to probability.

You also need to have strong programming skills in Python.

Note: if you don't meet all the prerequisites above please contact the instructor by email.

Optional, but recommended: experience with neural networks, such as from CSC321, introductory-level familiarity with reinforcement learning and control.
