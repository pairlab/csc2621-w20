Robots of the future will need to operate autonomously in unstructured and unseen environments. It is imperative that these systems are built on intelligent and adaptive algorithms. Learning by interaction through reinforcement offers a natural mechanism to postulate these problems.  

This graduate-level seminar course will cover topics and new research frontiers in reinforcement learning (RL). Planned topics include: Model-Based and Model-Free RL, Policy Search, Monte Carlo Tree Search, off policy evaluation, temporal abstraction/hierarchical approaches, inverse reinforcement learning and imitation learning.

**Learning objectives**  

At the end of this course, you will:  
1. Acquire familiarity with state of the art in RL
2. Articulate limitations of current work, identify open frontiers, and scope research projects. 
3. Constructively critique research papers, and deliver a tutorial style presentation. 
4. Work on a research based project, implement & evaluate experimental results, and discuss future work in a project paper. s
