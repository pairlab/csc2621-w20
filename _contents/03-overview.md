Learning by interaction or trial-and-error is a core aspect of any intelligence system. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm aiming to develop computational methods that allow intelligent agents to learn by interacting with their environments. In this course, we will cover the basic formulation of the Markov decision process (MDP), learning algorithms for tabular MDPs. This course will mainly focus on various function approximation methods using deep neural networks. The examples will include game playing and robot locomotion control.
